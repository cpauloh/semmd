# Open Terms and Definitions for Materials, Manufacturing, and Design
## The Basics
The vocabulary includes the definiton of a handful of classes:
* skos:Concept
  * tnd:TermAndDefinition
    * tnd:NdiTestMethod
    * tnd:UnitOfMeasure
* tnd:DefinitonSource
* tnd:RightsStatement

and one definition of an object property:
* tnd:originalSource

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute **open** terms and definitions, use tnd_template_0002.ttl as a starting point. It contains examples for individuals for each of the three classes:  tnd:TermAndDefinition, tnd:DefinitionSource, and tnd:RightsStatement.

If the terms and definitions require attribution (e.g. Creative Commons 4.0), please create an individual (of type tnd:RightsStatement) that defines the rights statement. 

Once you've created the file (preferably .ttl), please upload it to this directory.

## Future Work
The ontology schema will be seperated from the vocabulary.
